# Graduate Application Analysis

### Introduction
###### The project is aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis of universities' preference for accepting international students pursuing master's degrees at universities in the United States. This endeavor seeks to delve into the diverse demographic of students hailing from various corners of the globe who aspire to further their education in the United States. By examining key aspects of this phenomenon, the project aims to shed light on the motivations, trends, and patterns of particular universities and their preferences to give admits to students based on their profile, ultimately providing valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of higher education on an international scale.

###### Example:- University at Buffalo, NY gives less weightage to the GRE while more emphasis on the CGPA of Higher college and Work experience.

### Preparing data to perform Analysis
###### We have tried to scrape data of students going to the United States for higher education even though we could have easily gotten the dataset from Kagle as it is available over there.
###### Limitations of the dataset provided on Kagle.
###### i)the dataset was outdated as the data of students is till 2018 so we do not know the trends after 2020 or the effect of covid-19 pandemic that might affected the influx of students.
###### ii)The attributes were not enough to identify if the university preferred other parameters like CGPA or higher college degree, GRE/TOEFL score / Work experience. So in the new dataset, we have added various attributes like work experience, no of years of work experience, GRE/TOEFL score, etc.

### Data Preprocessing
###### After scraping the data of admits and rejects of students applying for Universities in the United States from Yocket. It was saved in a CSV file which was loaded and cleaned. Data was transformed as some attributes were in different formats example CGPA are out of 4 in some universities, out of 10, 100% in some university. So all the data should be brought to the same metrics.

### Performing Dynamic Exploratory Data Analysis
###### By analyzing data related to specific universities of interest, we can discern valuable trends and patterns in past admissions. This analysis, visualized effectively, can provide insights into each university's historical admission preferences, especially for computer science programs. Such insights empower prospective students to make informed, data-driven decisions about where to apply based on their own profiles, enhancing the chances of a successful application and enrollment.
